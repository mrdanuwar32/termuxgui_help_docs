Help on ModuleSpec in module importlib._bootstrap object:

class ModuleSpec(builtins.object)
 |  ModuleSpec(name, loader, *, origin=None, loader_state=None, is_package=None)
 |
 |  The specification for a module, used for loading.
 |
 |  A module's spec is the source for information about the module.  For
 |  data associated with the module, including source, use the spec's
 |  loader.
 |
 |  `name` is the absolute name of the module.  `loader` is the loader
 |  to use when loading the module.  `parent` is the name of the
 |  package the module is in.  The parent is derived from the name.
 |
 |  `is_package` determines if the module is considered a package or
 |  not.  On modules this is reflected by the `__path__` attribute.
 |
 |  `origin` is the specific location used by the loader from which to
 |  load the module, if that information is available.  When filename is
 |  set, origin will match.
 |
 |  `has_location` indicates that a spec's "origin" reflects a location.
 |  When this is True, `__file__` attribute of the module is set.
 |
 |  `cached` is the location of the cached bytecode file, if any.  It
 |  corresponds to the `__cached__` attribute.
 |
 |  `submodule_search_locations` is the sequence of path entries to
 |  search when importing submodules.  If set, is_package should be
 |  True--and False otherwise.
 |
 |  Packages are simply modules that (may) have submodules.  If a spec
 |  has a non-None value in `submodule_search_locations`, the import
 |  system will consider modules loaded from the spec as packages.
 |
 |  Only finders (see importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
 |  importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder) should modify ModuleSpec instances.
